     <strong><h2>Manjanggul Lava, JEJU</h2></strong>
      
    <p> The total length of Manjanggul Lava Tube is about 7.4km. It is a lava tube that is partially multilayered. 
       The main tunnelâ€™s width is 18m and its height is 23m. It is one of the largest lava tubes in the world. 
       There are many lava tubes in the world, but Manjanggul Lava Tube has a significant meaning in that it was formed thousands of years ago, and it is very well preserved. 
       Therefore, it is very valuable to researchers and scientists. Due to the sinking of the ceiling, there are 3 entrances. 
       The one that tourists can use is the second entrance and they are only allowed to go as far as 1km into it.</p>
