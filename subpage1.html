      style="width:650px;height:500px;"></right>
    <p style="font-family:courier;"> The total length of Manjanggul Lava Tube is about 7.4km. It is a lava tube that is partially multilayered. 
       The main tunnel’s width is 18m and its height is 23m. It is one of the largest lava tubes in the world. 
       There are many lava tubes in the world, but Manjanggul Lava Tube has a significant meaning in that it was formed thousands of years ago, and it is very well preserved. 
       Therefore, it is very valuable to researchers and scientists. Due to the sinking of the ceiling, there are 3 entrances. 
       The one that tourists can use is the second entrance and they are only allowed to go as far as 1km into it.</p>

   <p style="font-family:courier;">N Seoul Tower,also commonly known as Namsan Tower, is an iconic Seoul  landmark that provides bird’s-eye views of the city. It is both an observation and communication tower located at the top of Namsan Mountain in the geographical center of the city.
      N Seoul Tower is a very popular tourist spot and one of the top must-see attractions for any travel itinerary. 
      It is also a popular date spot among locals. N Seoul Tower is beautiful to look at from afar, especially at night. 
      Using the latest in LED technology, the tower is always lit up in various arrays of colors and patterns. 
      The protected area around N Seoul Tower is also intended to display the harmony that can exist between nature and 21st-century, state-of-the-art construction. 
      General car traffic is restricted in order to keep Namsan Mountain clean and green. Aside from a visit to the observation deck, one of the top activities for couples at N Seoul Tower is to hang a padlock from the fence around the plaza. 
      Couples inscribe their names, initials, or even a short message onto the locks before attaching them to the fence as a symbol of their eternal love.
